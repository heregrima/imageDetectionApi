# Synopsis
This folder is designed to hold the documentation for planning out how I'm to approach this API

# Summary
I'm going to spend time designing and setting up how I want to approach this problem.  Also, I plan to document my thought process to make it easier for reviewers to understand my process, my ideas, my justification for various design decisions and other pieces of this API exercise.  There's no wiki or issues set up, so I think I'm going to organize it in these READMEs in order to show my issue creation process too

# Details
