# Synopsis
This documentation is designed to inform technical users about the payload information I expect to send and receive for each of the 4 REST APIs

# Summary
The 4 routes to be made:
- POST /images
- GET /images
- GET /images?objects=
- GET /images/{imageId}

# Details

I organized everything into a Swagger YAML doc (heregrimaorganizatio-HEB-Images-1.0.0-swagger.yaml).  Just load into Swagger UI and see how the API is set up.  I don't have it connected to a URL yet - I just learned how to use it today from scratch.
